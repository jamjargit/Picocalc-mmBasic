Very simple MP3 player for Picocalc. mp3 files need to be in directory named music on the sd card.
The mp3 filenames need to be 33 characters or less.
The program uses the first 20 files in the directory but will adjust display if less than 20.
To play mp3 files the picocalc needs to have cpu speed set to 200000+
